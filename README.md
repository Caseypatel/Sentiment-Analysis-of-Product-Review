# Sentiment Analysis of Product Review
## Context:
- The objective of this project is to develop a classification model to predict whether an upcoming product will elicit positive or negative sentiment based on customer feedback and related data.
## Background:
- A customer review is feedback provided by a customer based on their experience with a product or service they have purchased or used. These reviews serve as a valuable form of consumer insight, particularly on e-commerce and online shopping platforms. Research indicates that 90% of consumers read online reviews before making a purchase, and 88% trust these reviews as much as personal recommendations, highlighting their significant impact on purchasing decisions.
